# HelloExtend Custom Warranty SKU

Custom Extend Module to change the SKU of the warranty product before the order is placed
the SKU was previously xtd-pp-pln, this builds a custom sku in the order based on the API response.
in this example, xtd-pp-pln-<TERM IN YEARS>


# Installation 
- copy the Helloextend/ folder in your app/code folder
- or use git to import and generate the files


PLEASE NOTE : This add-on only works for the current version of our module, called Helloextend/Integration or Extend_Integration, and the sku is xtd-pp-pln
